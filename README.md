This repo is an excerpt of my work from the original project as the project itself has a lot of proprietary technology from Vancouver Film School

**ORIGINAL DATE OF COMPLETION**: April 18, 2022

**Development Time** 2 Months

## **HIGH CONCEPT**

On a Roll is a single player, 2.5D side scroller where you play as Sisyphus, a Greek legend who defied the gods and is now doomed to roll a round, massive boulder to the top of a mountain for all eternity. You must overcome different obstacles, such as pits or lightning strikes along the way by throwing and catching the boulder to prevent it from rolling back down the mountain. The ultimate goal is to reach the summit of the mountain as fast as you can, defying the Gods once again as you secure your fastest time!
